# How are we going to start out with programming this thing?

Ideas for what language to use. 
1. Use Python. Either have constant real time audio processing
 - Use Python. Every few seconds, record a file for audio. Analyze that file to see if it has some loud noise. Return with notification
2. Use Java. Do the whole thing in java and the run on an app

First Implementation
- using speech recognition api on with python for real time signal processing. It listens for speech, and the returns a message. Should be as easy as voice threshold. 

Python with Apps
- Apps like Javascript and frontend languages. Python is backend, and...
Javascript runs on the client. I assume the python runs on the server. You could send an ajax request to the server. It won't be fast.
Using ajax, send text to a python script on your server. 
Set up the script to return data in an easy to parse (for js) notation (like JSON) and assign the result to arrOfStrings in the success handler.

we could use visual studio live share

1. Make the game in java
2. implement to website
3. pardy hard

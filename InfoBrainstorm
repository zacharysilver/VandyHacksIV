# How are we going to start out with programming this thing?

Ideas for what language to use. 
1. Use Python. Either have constant real time audio processing
 - Use Python. Every few seconds, record a file for audio. Analyze that file to see if it has some loud noise. Return with notification
2. Use Java. Do the whole thing in java and the run on an app

First Implementation
- using speech recognition api on with python for real time signal processing. It listens for speech, and the returns a message. Should be as easy as voice threshold.

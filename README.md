# VandyHacksIV

*This is our project for the 9th VandyHacks Hackathon.*

Our idea is to create a simple solution for the hard of hearing to hear loud and possibly important things around them so they don't miss a thing.
This will intially be a program running on a computer before we move it over to a phone app. 

Ok so 14 hours in, we've pivoted. We are now making a texted based random event "game" that chronicles the life of a fish. The app will have a theme of conservation, and throughout the game we'll be hitting the player with insane fish facts and info on conservation. 

## Characteristics of the game: 
- The turns will be short, and so the player will have to think on their feet. 
- In the end, your high score will be uploaded to a file (leaderboard). 
- If you make it through a fish's life successfully, then you continue as their offspring. You go until you die. 
- There will be random events, but the game will produce more environmental challenges as you progress through the years.

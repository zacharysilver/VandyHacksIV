# VandyHacksIV

This is a project for the 9th VandyHacks Hackathon.

Our idea is to create a simple solution for the hard of hearing to hear loud and possibly important things around them so they don't miss a thing.
This will intially be a program running on a computer before we move it over to a phone app.
